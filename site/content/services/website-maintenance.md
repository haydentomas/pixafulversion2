## Bad people are trying to hack your website right now

The Pixaful website security service is insurance for your website.

Website security is often overlooked by online business owners. Often a business does not see the benefit until it is too late.

Hackers can get into any website at any time, however there are some measures you can take to make sure this does not happen.

* Ensure your CMS is kept up to date
* Use a good quality security service
* Take regular on-site and off-site backups
* Ensure that purchased plugins come from the original source

Popular content management systems like Wordpress and Magento get hacked attempts daily.

Our security system can prevent all hack attempts on your website, and ensure that your data remains safe.

If you have already been hacked we will be required to take our <a href="#">malware cleanup service</a> before we can protect your site.

## How we protect your site

We install a PHP based firewall security system which protects your site 24 hours a day.

The firewall does the following:

* Block malicious traffic
* Create custom firewall rules
* Sends virtual patches to your website
* Monitors your websites for possible security issues and vulnerabilities. 
* Prevents malware infections
* Generates weekly security reports and stay alerted when anything needs your immediate attention

## How we backup your website

Backups are taken daily, weekly and monthly. How we backup depends on:

* The size of your website and database
* Your webhost
* Your CMS

## For clients that host with us

If you are hosting a webiste with Pixaful's premium webhosting service then you can expect the following:

* Daily on-site backups that last 30 days
* Daily off-site database backups delivered securely to our cloud
* Weekly off-site file backup taken every Sunday and stored locally
