## Your search for first class website development is over

I offer a premium website development service. Hand crafted specifically to your business.

My websites come with a stamp of quality that cannot be found anywhere else. 

* **Coded with care** - I prefer to hand code. I use modern maintainable code.
* **Built for speed** - Making sure your website loads as quickly as possible.
* **SEO ready** - Making sure your website gets seen by the right people.

Of course, this does not happen without proper planning, research and testing. I make it my business to understand your business and your competition.

I am a business consultant first and website developer second. I am interested in the sucess of your business.

I am not interested in building a pretty website and moving onto the next client, rather I prefer to develop long term business relationships. I offer a unique website development service unlike any other you may have experienced. 

A website developer that can offer tried and tested advice on what is working for online business today.

## The tools I use for building websites

Unlike many other website developers, I prefer not to lead with my choice of content management system. The CMS is not what makes money for your business. What makes money for your business is:

* An understanding of your clients online needs.
* Knowing how to turn a visitor into a prospect.
* Understanding UX for quick information retrieval.
* Understanding how colour affects your ROI.

The truth is that most website developers only care about making websites. They are building without considering real reasons behind the need for a website.

If you want more than a website, get in touch!

## If you do care about my tech stack

* **CMS:** Magento, Wordpress, DNN, Hugo
* **Languages:** Javascript, PHP, Ruby
* **Software:** Adobe Creative Cloud, Affinity

## Honestly, my tech stack is not what makes you money. They really are cool buzzwords that make me look good!

Get in touch to ask about my website development services, let's discuss your project! I am very interested in helping your business grow online.
