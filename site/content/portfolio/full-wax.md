## Aircraft Detailing Company required Website + Rankings


This is our third web development project with The Full Wax. We have been working with the company for a number of years.

What originally began as a flash website has been developed into an easy to manage, lightning fast Wordpress website.

The website loads very quickly and holds a first page ranking in Google for a number of keywords.

The client wanted to:

1. Manage the website.
2. Create their own templates using a pre defined set of blocks.
3. Update the content whenever they like without having to ask me to do it.

They also requested that:

1. The website was secure.
2. Daily, weekly and monthly off-site backups were maintained.

## A distinct look and feel

The brand is an all black design with a silver logo. The vans have them as does the company business card. This is reflected throughout the website which is responsive from mobile to desktop.


## SEO

Every page has been well optimised with SEO best practices, including open graph, twitter cards. 

I am currently developing a personalised SEO programme for The Full Wax which will ensure that the company continues to thrive in 2019 and 2020.
