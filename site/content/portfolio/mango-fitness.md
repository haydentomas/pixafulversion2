## Managing a growing client based is now a breeze for Mango Fitness

Mango Fitness is a long standing client for which I have developed websites and online marketing material for email campaigns.

I used Wordpress for this project alongside Elementor and GeneratePress.

A page builder was an obvious choice for this project.
A tight budget and the conversations we have on the telephone to discuss projects means I can do quick changes on the fly.

The client can see them before the converation has even finished.

The site loads very quickly and is packed with engaging elements throughout.


The client wanted to:

1. Manage their existing client base via the website.
2. Allow their clients to see progress reports, and updates via their own members area.
3. Provide specific content to different levels of membership.

They also requested that:

1. The website had good security so it could not be hacked.
2. Back-ups were maintained on a schedule.

## A distinct look and feel

Mango Fitness is a very colourful website, I had lots to choose from as the logo had a dash of everything!


## SEO

Every page has been well optimised with SEO best practices, including open graph, twitter cards.
