## Boost your website security in 10 easy steps

Website security is a serious subject. Websites are being hacked on a daily basis. You can protect your digital assets  by following a few simple rules.

* **Use a good webhost** - A good webhost will include  malware scanners, up to date PHP and security.  Some services are addons but they should at least be available.  At Pixaful we use SiteGround.
* **Install a firewall** - A firewall will ensure that  most bad guys will not bother you. Hackers are looking easy pickings by scanning for  know vulnerabilities. A firewall is your first line of defence and will  protect you from most types of attacks.
* **Keep your CMS updated** - Wordpress we are looking at  you! But no matter what CMS you are on, you should keep it updated.  
* **Keep your plugins updated** - Wordpress uses the term plugins, but your CMS may use addons, modules or anything else! The point is make sure any extra features you have included from third party suppliers get updated.
* **Keep your themes updated** - Themes are a target for hackers because they contain scripts that go out of date very quickly and can be exploited. If you buy a theme from a marketplace then make sure you check it for updates.
* **Keep regular backups** - Even if you do not do any of the above and decide to totally ignore my advice, your ass can be saved with a backup. You will learn from it and then probably implement the previous 5 steps! Backups can be taken on a server and offline. I recommend you do both regularly.
* **Use strong passwords** - And never use them twice! I use a password manager called 1Password. I don't know my passwords and thats the way I like it, though making paypal payments can get annoying but definately worth the extra hassle!
* **Install an SSL certificate** - These days these are free. Most good hosts offer Let's Encrypt SSL at the very least. This prevents hackers from intercepting these pieces of information and using them to their advantage.
* **Keep old domains** - If you have used a domain for any type of sensititive information, its best to hang onto it. Hackers don't even have to try if you decide to let go of a domain. For a mere $10 purchase and a quick google search they can register a domain and look up lost passwords and have all the access they need.
