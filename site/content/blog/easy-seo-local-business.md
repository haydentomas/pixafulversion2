## SEO for Local Business - A step by step guide

If you are a local business and are having trouble getting your website to rank, read on!

I have been developing and marketing websites for local bsuiensses for 8 years. As part of my development process for any local business I always make SEO part of the package.

SEO is expensive, both in time and money. If you have time it is something you can do yourself (this guide will help you). 

If you have money then get in touch, we can get an SEO action plan in place. We can help your business get noticed online.

**A quick 5 step SEO action plan for local businesses**

Before you do anything on your website, you need to do your research. It is important to understand that Google does not care how good looking your website is. If your content is not relevant to your topic, you won't get any traffic. 

**Research is your first step.** You can use a keyword research tool to get the job done and find the key words and phrases that matter to your business. Google has a keyword research tool called "Google keyword Planner". 

There are other paid tools that can go deeper than what Google can uncover for you. It is up to you what tool you use but ensure that you get enough keywords to get you started. Your visitors need a reason to come back time and time again. It all starts with keyword research.

During the keyword discovery phase, it is also important to grab competition data. Finding out how hard a keyword is to rank for is very important. You dont want to write a 2000 word article that gets buried in search results!

Keyword research is an ongoing task. You need to do it consistently so that you can maximise the results you achieve from SEO.

**Check out your competition**

SEO is very niche dependent. Some markets are easy to rank as they do much of their work offline, or have lower marketing budgets. This means somebody with knowledge can outrank the competition without too much trouble.

Other markets, for example web design, marketing or anything related to the web have a tough time! We need to put some real effort in to gain traction.

That being said there is always a gap in every market that needs to be filled.
